width: calc((100% - 10px)/2);

Examples:

Fixed size image

width: 100%

max width: 100%

You can find out more about calc() from Mozilla Developer Network.

# no margin on last image
img:last-of-type { margin-right:0;}

# even though margin 10px is just on the right side
# we still remove 20px from the width of the image
margin-right:10px;
width:calc((100% - 20px) / 3);

vh = view port height

for full width or full height of screen (this will scale)
width: 100vmin;
height: 100vmin;

for full width or full height of screen (no scaleing)
width: 100vmax;
height: 100vmax;

Did you notice how setting both the height and the width to 100vmax or 
100vmin changes the image's aspect ratio? It'll compress your images to squares, 
so be careful if you want to maintain a different aspect ratio!

Open the SVG v PNG example in a large display â€“ you'll see a massive difference in quality!
